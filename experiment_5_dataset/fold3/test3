22,0,rocks are changing constantly from one type to another. if you wanted to describe these processes to someone  how would you do it? would you use words or pictures? scientists have created a model in diagram form called the rock cycle to show how different kinds of rock are related to one another and how rocks change from one type to another. each rock is on a continuing journey through the rock cycle  as shown in figure 23. a trip through the rock cycle takes millions of years.  the rock cycle  heat and pressure  melting  heat and pressure  metamorphic rock  melting  melting  igneous rock  cooling  magma  section 3 metamorphic rocks and the rock cycle 395  figure 23 this diagram of the rock cycle shows how rocks are recycled constantly from one kind of rock to another.  contents  the rock cycle  compaction and cementation  weathering and erosion  weathering and erosion  sedimentary rock  sediment  weathering and erosion
