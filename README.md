## Introduction

Arrows are a key ingredient of schematic pictorial communication. This paper investigates the interpretation of arrows through linguistic, crowdsourcing and machine-learning methodology. Our work establishes a novel analogy between arrows and verbs: we advocate representing ar- rows in terms of qualitatively different structural and semantic frames, and resolving frames to specific interpretations using shallow world knowledge.
