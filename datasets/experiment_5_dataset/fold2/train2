549,0,adult monarchs lay one small egg on an individual milkweed plant. the egg is about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.   egg  progressing from egg to adult takes about one month depending on temperature. larvae consume a lot of milkweed and grow very rapidly. they grow so fast  they need to shed their skin five times before they pupate.  adult  larva  monarch wings are folded in the chrysalis.  the monarch must pump up its wings using fluid stored in its abdomen.  monarchs live from 2-5 weeks before reproducing and laying eggs of the next generation.  pupa  monarch larvae transform into pupa  also known as chrysalis. the pupa turns to a jade color with gold markings. the chrysalis becomes clear just prior to emergence.
